Note that the directories/files with the following filenames is ignored by git.
(You can take your own note in `tmp_<name>.txt` so that it won't be pushed to github)

```
tmp_*
bad/
data/
results/
models/
```

For data and result files let's upload them to [our Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FEdclRfkG94itz59VTF9sO-3LBzFKRgZ?usp=sharing).
